# My Dot-Files

## Setup

* Clone the repository either into ~/dotfiles or C:\dotfiles
* Copy the files inside dotfiles/bootstrap manually to their locations
* In the Windows environment variables, set `CHERE_INVOKING="something"`
  This makes ConsoleZ's clone tab work properly with bash
  (see what happens with the variable in Cygwin's /etc/profile for details)

## TODOs

* .bashrc (or the relevant parts of it) are currently not in my dotfiles
